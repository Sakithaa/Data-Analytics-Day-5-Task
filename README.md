# Data-Analytics-Day-5-Task
Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic  (Train) dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

##  Objective
Perform EDA to identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies in Titanic passenger data.

##  Tools Used
- VS Code
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
Dataset: Titanic Dataset (train.csv)  
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv&utm_source=chatgpt.com    


##  Files in this Repository
- **task_5.ipynb** → Full Jupyter Notebook with code, visuals, and observations.
- **TASK_5.pdf** → PDF report of findings.
- **train.csv** → Titanic dataset used for analysis.

##  Steps Followed
1. Data loading & inspection (`.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`).
2. Missing value analysis.
3. Univariate analysis (histograms, count plots).
4. Bivariate analysis (boxplots, scatterplots, correlation heatmap).
5. Pairplot for overall variable relationships.
6. Summary of findings.

##  Observations
- Majority passengers were male.
- Most passengers were from 3rd class.
- Survival rate higher among females and 1st class passengers.

##  Outcome
Gained experience in:
- Detecting trends, patterns, anomalies.
- Using Pandas for data summary.
- Creating effective visualizations with Matplotlib & Seaborn.
